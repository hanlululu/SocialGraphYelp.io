Welcome to the Las Vegas Hotels Network 
==================================

In this project we have been working with a subset of the Yelp dataset in order to model the network of hotels in Las Vegas based on customer reviews. 

The ___Yelp___ online service is an application which stores, aggregates and displays crowdsourced reviews about businesses published in their internal database. One of main benefits of this service for its customers lies in the massive amounts of reviews which Yelp provides about a business, allowing its users to get an informed decision of whether a certain business fits their category of needs or not. However, when using the Web interface of the service, we have noticed some less-desired user experience choices, such as for example not setting a word limit to their reviews or only showing 10 businesses at a time on their comparison map. The lack of a review word limit has allowed reviews to become very generous in size, up to the point where it is difficult to get a quick overview about the performance of a business, since one is met by a "wall of text".

We have decided to use Data Science to improve upon these points, by providing interactive visualizations for the set of Yelp-relevant businesses across a defined area, as well as analyse their (many and lengthy) reviews automatically using Natural Language Processing, in order to get an informed idea on the top businesses which exist in a chosen geographical region, where Yelp also operates and is active.
