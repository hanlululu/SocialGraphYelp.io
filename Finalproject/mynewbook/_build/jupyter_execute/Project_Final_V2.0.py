# ## 1. Introduction and Motivation

# The ___Yelp___ online service is an application which stores, aggregates and displays crowdsourced reviews about businesses published in their internal database. One of main benefits of this service for its customers lies in the massive amounts of reviews which Yelp provides about a business, allowing its users to get an informed decision of whether a certain business fits their category of needs or not. However, when using the Web interface of the service, we have noticed some less-desired user experience choices, such as for example not setting a word limit to their reviews or only showing 10 businesses at a time on their comparison map. The lack of a review word limit has allowed reviews to become very generous in size, up to the point where it is difficult to get a quick overview about the performance of a business, since one is met by a "wall of text".
# 
# We have decided to use Data Science to improve upon these points, by providing interactive visualizations for the set of Yelp-relevant businesses across a defined area, as well as analyse their (many and lengthy) reviews automatically using Natural Language Processing, in order to get an informed idea on the top businesses which exist in a chosen geographical region, where Yelp also operates and is active.
# 
# ---
# 
# The original dataset that we have selected to analyse this problem is the [Yelp dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset). This dataset contains a large subset of Yelp's businesses, reviews, check-ins and user-related public anonymous data. It was originally created for the Kaggle _Yelp Dataset Challenge_ which encouraged academics to conduct research or analysis on
# the company's subset of data and show their discoveries to the world. 
# 
# The original __Yelp Academic Dataset__ contains information about 1.637.138 reviews collected from 192.609 businesses across 10 metropolitan areas in multiple countries of the world. Since this dataset is extremely large to work with (containing __10+ GB of data__), we have subsetted the data further into __one geographical area of interest: Las Vegas, US__, and __one business category: Hotels__. 
# 
# The reason for choosing Las Vegas as our geographical boundary is because it is the city in the dataset with most active Yelp user and business base, meaning that there is a large number of reviews and businesses signed up on the platform. Also, choosing Hotels was a choice of interest, since Las Vegas is famous for their 2-in-1 "Hotel & Casino" buildings and for their good services, so we wanted to understand more about the Hotel landscape in such a dynamic environment.
# 
# ---

# ### __The main steps of this project will involve:__
# 
# 1. Segmenting the dataset and cleaning it
#     - <span style="color:green"> We will segment businesses to only include Las Vegas hotels </span>
#     - <span style="color:green"> We will segment reviews to only include the ones directly related to our business </span><br><br>
# 2. Finding the top most important keywords which define each Hotel business in part, using the TF-IDF metric
#     - <span style="color:green"> The top keywords will be detected by analysing all the reviews of each business in part </span><br><br>
# 3. Create a network of connected businesses, both statically in a graph-like visualization, as well as a geomap plot of the businesses we are targetting
#     - <span style="color:green"> Two nodes (i.e. businesses) will be connected if they have a top keyword in common </span>
#     - <span style="color:green"> The weight of the edges will be dependent on the total number of top keywords that the businesses share in common </span><br><br>
# 4. Identify relevant communities/clusters within the Hotels dataset, and plot their properties in graph, dynamic, as well as temporal visualizations<br><br>
# 5. Understand which businesses & communities are seen most positively or negatively, and look into how the sentiments evolve over period of day and year
#     - <span style="color:green"> This will be done firstly by performing sentiment analysis on the reviews of our dataset </span>
#     - <span style="color:green"> Secondly, this involves detecting the temportal change in sentiments across businesses </span>

# Now, we will proceed in filtering, subsetting and cleaning the original full Yelp Academic Dataset, according to the flowchart schema below:
# 
# ![flowchart.png](attachment:flowchart.png)

# <a id='2.1.'></a>
# ### 2.1. Stage 1: Filtering & subsetting from the full 10GB+ dataset
# 
# _Here, we are filtering the 10GB+ original dataset into the subset selected specifically for our analysis, and saving the corresponding data subsets as individual CSV files:_

# <a id='2.1.1.'></a>
# #### 2.1.1. Stage 1.1: Loading the `business` dataframe:

# First, we will load the dataframe containing all businesses in the Yelp dataset:

# In[6]:


yelp_all_businesses_df = pd.read_json('yelp_dataset/yelp_academic_dataset_business.json', lines = True)


# Let us check for the most proeminent cities within this dataset, meaning that they have most amount of businesses on the platform:

# In[7]:


yelp_all_businesses_df.city.value_counts()


# We argue that, even though Yelp businesses are registered every day throughout major cities in the whole world, this is a subsetted dataset, which has been curated by Yelp for research purposes, and, in here, the city where most of the data is present is actually Las Vegas in Nevada, USA. 
# 
# Since we want to have some substantial amount of analysis data, we want to select a city where Yelp is popular and where it is used actively. Therefore, we will use Las Vegas as the target city where we will do our analysis in.

# <a id='2.1.2.'></a>
# #### 2.1.2. Stage 1.2: Subsetting the `business` dataframe for __Las Vegas__ data:

# We are now interested in focusing our analysis on a specific city chosen for this project: **Las Vegas**.

# In[8]:


all_business_las_vegas_df = yelp_all_businesses_df[yelp_all_businesses_df.city == 'Las Vegas']

# We want to drop businesses without any categories, since we won't be able to filter after them anyway
all_business_las_vegas_df = all_business_las_vegas_df.loc[all_business_las_vegas_df.categories.dropna().index]


# We would like to save a dataset relative to all the ___Hotels___ in Las Vegas, in order to use it for review analysis and network creation:

# In[9]:


hotels_las_vegas_df = all_business_las_vegas_df[all_business_las_vegas_df.categories.str.contains('Hotels')]


# Next, we need to retrieve the ID list of all the Hotels in Las Vegas, in order to subset the subsequent datasets by business ID:

# In[10]:


business_ids_all_business_las_vegas = list(all_business_las_vegas_df.business_id)
business_ids_hotels_las_vegas = list(hotels_las_vegas_df.business_id)


# Finally, let us save the subsetted business dataset into its own CSV file:

# In[11]:


all_business_las_vegas_df.to_csv('yelp_dataset/las_vegas_all_business.csv', index = False)
hotels_las_vegas_df.to_csv('yelp_dataset/las_vegas_hotel_business.csv', index = False)


# In[12]:


del yelp_all_businesses_df
del all_business_las_vegas_df
del hotels_las_vegas_df


# <a id='2.1.3.'></a>
# #### 2.1.3. Stage 1.3: Subsetting the `reviews` dataframe for __Las Vegas__ data:

# The *reviews* JSON file is very large (1.5GB+), and often is bound to give memory errors when trying to read it directly from using the specialized `read_json` functions of `pandas` or `dask`. Therefore, we need a more Python-traditional approach:

# In[13]:


with open('yelp_dataset/yelp_academic_dataset_review.json', mode = 'r', encoding = 'utf8') as json_file:
    data = json_file.readlines()
    data = list(map(json.loads, data))
    
yelp_all_reviews_df = pd.DataFrame(data)


# After we are able to load the data, we will filter the reviews and only keep the ones relevant to Las Vegas, in order to diminish its heavy memory consumption.
# 
# Initially, we will filter by all reviews relevant to all businesses in **Las Vegas**:

# In[14]:


all_reviews_las_vegas_df = yelp_all_reviews_df[yelp_all_reviews_df.business_id.isin(business_ids_all_business_las_vegas)]


# Next, we will also filter the reviews of hotels in Las Vegas:

# In[15]:


hotels_reviews_las_vegas_df = all_reviews_las_vegas_df[all_reviews_las_vegas_df.business_id.isin(business_ids_hotels_las_vegas)]


# Lastly, in order to filter the `Tips` and `Users` datasets, we will also store the IDs of the users writing all these reviews:

# In[16]:


user_ids_all_reviews_las_vegas = list(all_reviews_las_vegas_df.user_id)
user_ids_hotels_las_vegas = list(hotels_reviews_las_vegas_df.user_id)


# Let us save these 2 datasets for analysis at a later stage:

# In[17]:


all_reviews_las_vegas_df.to_csv('yelp_dataset/las_vegas_all_reviews.csv', index = False)
hotels_reviews_las_vegas_df.to_csv('yelp_dataset/las_vegas_hotel_reviews.csv', index = False)


# In[18]:


del yelp_all_reviews_df
del all_reviews_las_vegas_df
del hotels_reviews_las_vegas_df


# <a id='2.1.4.'></a>
# #### 2.1.4. Stage 1.4: Subsetting the `checkins` dataframe for __Las Vegas__ data:

# Just like before, we will repeat identical steps for the `Checkins` dataset:

# In[19]:


yelp_all_checkins_df = pd.read_json('yelp_dataset/yelp_academic_dataset_checkin.json', lines = True)
all_checkins_las_vegas_df = yelp_all_checkins_df[yelp_all_checkins_df.business_id.isin(business_ids_all_business_las_vegas)]
hotels_checkins_las_vegas_df = all_checkins_las_vegas_df[all_checkins_las_vegas_df.business_id.isin(business_ids_hotels_las_vegas)]


# In[20]:


all_checkins_las_vegas_df.to_csv('yelp_dataset/las_vegas_all_checkins.csv', index = False)
hotels_checkins_las_vegas_df.to_csv('yelp_dataset/las_vegas_hotel_checkins.csv', index = False)


# In[21]:


del yelp_all_checkins_df
del all_checkins_las_vegas_df
del hotels_checkins_las_vegas_df


# <a id='2.1.5.'></a>
# #### 2.1.5. Stage 1.5: Subsetting the `tips` dataframe for __Las Vegas__ data:

# The same steps will be used for the `Tips` dataset:

# In[22]:


yelp_all_tips_df = pd.read_json('yelp_dataset/yelp_academic_dataset_tip.json', lines = True)
all_tips_las_vegas_df = yelp_all_tips_df[(yelp_all_tips_df.business_id.isin(business_ids_all_business_las_vegas) & (yelp_all_tips_df.user_id.isin(user_ids_all_reviews_las_vegas)))]
hotels_tips_las_vegas_df = all_tips_las_vegas_df[(all_tips_las_vegas_df.business_id.isin(business_ids_hotels_las_vegas) & all_tips_las_vegas_df.user_id.isin(user_ids_hotels_las_vegas))]


# In[23]:


all_tips_las_vegas_df.to_csv('yelp_dataset/las_vegas_all_tips.csv', index = False)
hotels_tips_las_vegas_df.to_csv('yelp_dataset/las_vegas_hotel_tips.csv', index = False)


# In[24]:


del yelp_all_tips_df
del all_tips_las_vegas_df
del hotels_tips_las_vegas_df


# <a id='2.1.6.'></a>
# #### 2.1.6. Stage 1.6: Subsetting the `users` dataframe for __Las Vegas__ data:

# Finally, precisely similar steps will also be used upon the `Users` dataset:

# In[25]:


with open('yelp_dataset/yelp_academic_dataset_user.json', mode = 'r', encoding = 'utf8') as json_file:
    data = json_file.readlines()
    data = list(map(json.loads, data))
    
yelp_all_users_df = pd.DataFrame(data)


# In[26]:


all_users_las_vegas_df = yelp_all_users_df[yelp_all_users_df.user_id.isin(user_ids_all_reviews_las_vegas)]
hotels_users_las_vegas_df = all_users_las_vegas_df[all_users_las_vegas_df.user_id.isin(user_ids_hotels_las_vegas)]


# In[27]:


all_users_las_vegas_df.to_csv('yelp_dataset/las_vegas_all_users.csv', index = False)
hotels_users_las_vegas_df.to_csv('yelp_dataset/las_vegas_hotel_users.csv', index = False)


# In[28]:


del yelp_all_users_df
del all_users_las_vegas_df
del hotels_users_las_vegas_df


# <a id='2.2.'></a>
# ### 2.2. Stage 2: Performing data cleaning on the `business` dataframe

# We need to read again the dataframes containing the businesses of Las Vegas, because we previously deleted them from memory, in order to make space for other operations:

# In[29]:


las_vegas_all_business_df = pd.read_csv('yelp_dataset/las_vegas_all_business.csv')
las_vegas_hotel_business_df = pd.read_csv('yelp_dataset/las_vegas_hotel_business.csv')


# <a id='2.2.1.'></a>
# #### 2.2.1. Stage 2.1: Cleaning the `attributes` column:

# Here, we will clean the `attributes` column into a JSON-parsable format:

# In[30]:


def wrangle_attributes(row):
    attributes_data = row.attributes
    
    if (pd.isnull(attributes_data)):
        row['attributes'] = '{}'
        return row
        
    attributes_data = attributes_data.replace("\"u\'", "\'")
    attributes_data = attributes_data.replace('\'', '\"')
    attributes_data = attributes_data.replace('""', '"')
    attributes_data = attributes_data.replace('"{', '{')
    attributes_data = attributes_data.replace('}"', '}')
    attributes_data = attributes_data.replace(' False', ' "False"')
    attributes_data = attributes_data.replace(' True', ' "True"')
    attributes_data = attributes_data.replace(' None', ' "None"')
    
    row['attributes'] = attributes_data
    return row


# Now, we will apply the above-created function to each row in the datasets, using a `lambda` function:

# In[31]:


las_vegas_all_business_df = las_vegas_all_business_df.apply(lambda row: wrangle_attributes(row), axis = 1)

las_vegas_hotel_business_df = las_vegas_hotel_business_df.apply(lambda row: wrangle_attributes(row), axis = 1)


# <a id='2.2.2.'></a>
# #### 2.2.2. Stage 2.2: Cleaning the `hours` column:

# Next, we need to properly convert the `hours` column into a fixed and consistent hour format:

# In[32]:


def wrangle_hours(row):
    hours_data = row.hours
    
    if (pd.isnull(hours_data)):
        row['hours'] = '{}'
        return row
        
    hours_data = hours_data.replace('\'', '\"')
    hours_data = hours_data.replace('""', '"')
    hours_data = hours_data.replace('"{', '{')
    hours_data = hours_data.replace('}"', '}')
    hours_data = hours_data.replace(':0', ':00')
    
    row['hours'] = hours_data
    return row


# Let us apply the time format conversion function to all necessary rows:

# In[33]:


las_vegas_all_business_df = las_vegas_all_business_df.apply(lambda row: wrangle_hours(row), axis = 1)
las_vegas_hotel_business_df = las_vegas_hotel_business_df.apply(lambda row: wrangle_hours(row), axis = 1)


# Lastly, we will save our updated datasets in place of the un-wrangled ones:

# In[34]:


las_vegas_all_business_df.to_csv('yelp_dataset/las_vegas_all_business.csv', index = False)
las_vegas_hotel_business_df.to_csv('yelp_dataset/las_vegas_hotel_business.csv', index = False)


# <a id='2.3.'></a>
# ### 2.3. Filtering the dataset by geographic location and business category

# Let us remember that, previously, after every dataframe segmentation, we have deleted the dataframe from memory in order to free up resources for the subsequent parts of the cleaning process.
# 
# Therefore, now, let us reload only the dataframes which are of immediate interest, and, since we did not filter yet by either ___geographic location___ or ___business category___, we will need to take care of that now.

# In[35]:


business_df = pd.read_csv('./yelp_dataset/las_vegas_all_business.csv')
review_df = pd.read_csv('./yelp_dataset/las_vegas_all_reviews.csv')
user_df = pd.read_csv('./yelp_dataset/las_vegas_all_users.csv')


# Here, we will filter data according to a specific kind of business category (_Hotels_, in this case). However, the dificulty here rises, since there are two category types which we can encounter:
# 
# 1. `Hotels & Travel`, which are referring to any kind of business directly or indirectly relating to the Hotel industry, including also car rentals services or Spas.
# 
# 
# 2. `Hotels`, which are referring specifically to the businesses providing lodging as an accredited Hotel. __This business category is the only one that we are interested in.__
# 
# Since one of the categories contains the name of the other, we have decided to solve this problem with the use of ___Regular Expressions___ for filtering the category:

# In[36]:


# Filter the business_id according to the "Hotels" category
filter_business_id = business_df[business_df.categories.str.contains(r"(Hotels, )|(, Hotels$)", regex = True) == True].business_id


# Now, we will re-update the business and review dataframes to only contain the filtered dataset:

# In[37]:


# Update the business dataframe with only the relevant Hotel businesses
business_df = business_df[business_df.business_id.isin(filter_business_id)].reset_index().drop('index', axis = 1)                         .rename({'stars': 'stars_business'})


# In[38]:


# Filter all the reviews based strictly on the 'business_id' corresponding to a Hotel's business_id
review_df = review_df[review_df.business_id.isin(filter_business_id)].reset_index().drop('index', axis = 1)                         .rename({'stars': 'stars_review'})


# --- 
# <a id='3.'></a>
# ## 3. Descriptive statistics about the dataset

# After the full segmentation and cleaning has been performed, let us try to understand our dataset a little bit better. We will afterwards jump into the __Text Analytics__ part for finding important top business keywords, so it is important to know how large a  scale does our analysis have to deal with.

# In[39]:


print('The total number of unique businesses/hotels in our dataset is:', business_df.shape[0])


# In[40]:


business_df.info(memory_usage = 'deep');


# It seems that our Hotels dataframe contains __438 unique businesses__, which will also be the starting nodes for our network analysis graph later on. The dataframe uses about ~450 KB of memory, since we have filtered the dataset appropriately until we now a compact dataframe. The original `all_business` dataframe was requiring 20.3 MB of memory, which would not be a problem either.
# 
# The real challenge is working upon the large Reviews dataframe, since the original size of the `all_reviews` file was 1.6 GB alone. Let us see how many relevant reviews are we working with, and how large is our current dataset:

# In[41]:


print('The total number of unique reviews (relating to the hotel businesses in our dataset) is:', review_df.shape[0])


# In[42]:


review_df.info(memory_usage = 'deep');


# As we can see from the memory usage footprint, the Reviews dataframe has also been reduced significantly in size to only 12.5% of the original size, while the number of reviews we will be analyzing is kept at a larger scale. This is really relevant, since more reviews will allow us to extract the important features when doing: __keyword detection, topic modeling, sentiment analysis__.

# The network graph is highly dependent on the NLP analysis we will perform next. The nodes in our network will be connected depending on the amount of top keywords which their aggregated reviews have in common, therefore we cannot give a direct estimation of the number of edges in the network just yet. 
# 
# Let us move onwards to the TFIDF-powered keyword detection, in order to identify what kind of keywords are best representing each Hotel business, and what makes the businesses "stand out".

# --- 
# <a id='4.'></a>
# ## 4. Keyword detection using TF-IDF (NLP)

# Before we can analyze the aggregated reviews for each unique business, we would like to perform a JOIN operation on the `reviews` and the `business` dataframes, so that every review will also have metadata about the actual business that it is linked to. 
# 
# Since the `reviews` and the `business` dataframes share the common attribute `business_id`, we can JOIN the two tables/dataframes on that variable:

# In[43]:


business_review_df = pd.merge(business_df, review_df, on = 'business_id', how = 'outer')
business_review_df.head(1)


# When tokenizing the text of the reviews, we have performed multiple tests, and since we are dealing with user-written reviews of amenities they might have strong opinions on, the most important parts of speech for our analysis are: ___adjectives___. More specifically, the NLTK algorithm will consider an adjective to be any word which directly precedes a noun. A list of English nouns is predefined in their models.
# 
# Therefore, in order to remove neutral words and enhance the understanding of the customers' feelings towards hotels, the full text in a review has been tokenized and cleaned, yet only the adjectives in such a review have been extracted.
# 
# Also, since this decision has been made, we have also opted for not lemmatizing our wordset, since adjectives normally only have 1 single form of conjugating, therefore lemmatizing would be an unnecessary process for us.

# The function below is responsible for the text parsing and cleaning, including operations such as:
# 
# * Tokenizing (separating long text into words/tokens)
# * Removing punctuation and non-alphanumeric characters
# * Removing stopwords (very frequenct English auxiliary words with no meaningful value)

# In[44]:


# Function for tokenizing the text into a list of words

def tokenize_text(text):
    # Replace all the non-alphanumeric characters with space
    text = re.sub(r'[\W]', ' ', text)
    
    # Function to test if something is an adjective
    is_adj = (lambda pos: pos[:2] == 'JJ')

    # Tokenize texts into lists of tokens
    words = word_tokenize(text)    
   
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    
    # Remove punctuation and set words to lowercase
    words = [word.lower() for word in words if word not in string.punctuation]
    
    # Remove stopwords and letters (stopwords are lowercase, so this step should be done after word.lower())
    words = [word for word in words
                 if word not in stop_words
                 if len(word) > 1]    
    
    # Keep adjectives only
    words = [word for (word, pos) in nltk.pos_tag(words) if is_adj(pos)]

    return words


# The function below has been written for two purposes: 
# 
# 1. For a specific business, it concatenates all the individual reviews into one large string
# 
# 
# 2. For a specific community, (which we will discuss later in the Network Analysis part), it will concatenate all the reviews from businesses belonging to a community into one large string

# In[45]:


def reviews(df, mode, dict_communities = None):
    
    if mode == 'community':
        # Create a dictionary for storing text of each community
        community_reviews = {}
        
        for comm in dict_communities.keys():
            community_text = ' '
            for business_id in dict_communities[comm]:
                business_text = ' '.join(df[df.business_id == business_id].text)
                community_text += business_text
                
            community_reviews[comm] = community_text
            
        return community_reviews
      
    if mode == 'business':
        # For each business, find its reviews
        business_reviews = {}
        
        for business_id in df.business_id.unique():      
            # Concatenate all reviews of a specific business into one text
            business_text = ' '.join(df[df.business_id == business_id].text)
            business_reviews[business_id] = business_text
            
        return business_reviews


# In the next code paragraphs, we create functions for calculating some of the most important NLP metrics for our review analysis: the TF score, the IDF score, and their combined TF-IDF metric upon the aggregated reviews for each unique Hotel.

# First, we will define how to compute the Term Frequency for each word, which is simply a frequency count for each of the words.

# From literature, we can find numerous ways of calculating the weights of terms which can be applied:
# 
# * __Raw count__: This method simply counts the occurrence of each word.
# 
# 
# * __Term frequency__: This method takes the total number of words of each document into account. For instance, if the counts of a word is high, but not high comparing to the total amount of words shown in a text, then this word is likely to not be too important.
# 
# 
# * __Log__: This method uses the logarithm scale, which manages to shrink the difference of weights between highly frequent words and less frequent ones.
# 
# 
# * __Double normalization__: This method aims to mitigate the case that we observe higher term frequencies in longer documents, merely because longer documents tend to repeat the same words over and over again.

# For our further analysis, we chose to use the ___`term frequency`___ calculation method for our scenarios, since it normalizes the original frequency (i.e. raw counts) by also considering the length of reviews.
# 
# This is very useful considering that the written reviews vary significantly in terms of their size and amount of words. In order to avoid words which would get high weights because they appear often in longer texts, the `term frequency` function will solve that problem by adjusting the score to the review length.

# Next in our analysis, after the TF (Term Frequency) score is computed, we also need to define the computation of the IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) score, which measures how informative a word is across all the documents. 
# 
# Here we will implement two ways of calculating IDF scores: 
# 
# * __idf__: This method calculates the IDF score directly using the logarithm of the ratio $\frac{N}{n_t}$, where $N$ denotes the total number of documents, while $n_t$ denotes the number of documents where the word occurs in. If the IDF score is low, it means that the word is common not only in one document, but tends to show up in several documents. This suggests that such a word might not be informative.
# 
# 
# * __idf_smooth__: This method is a modified version of original IDF, to solve the situation when a word occurs 0 times.

# In[47]:


# Function for computing IDF (using different methods)

def idf(reviews, term_frequency, idf_method):
    
    # Total number of documents (i.e. total number of businesses in this case, because we concatenate all the reviews of one specific business)
    N = len(reviews.keys())
    
    # Create a nested dictionary for {business: {word: idf score}} storing term-frequency
    inverse_document_frequency = {}
    
    for comm1 in term_frequency.keys():
        # Update the idf dictionary into form as {business: {word: 0}}
        inverse_document_frequency[comm1] = {k : 0 for k in term_frequency[comm1].keys()}
        
        for word in term_frequency[comm1]:
            # If a specific word occurs in another business, add 1 to the count of this word
            for comm2 in term_frequency.keys():
                if word in term_frequency[comm2].keys():
                    inverse_document_frequency[comm1][word] += 1
        
        # Compute different types of inverse document frequency based on the number of occurance of a word in all the businesses
        if idf_method == 'idf':
            inverse_document_frequency[comm1] = {k : math.log(N/v) for k, v in inverse_document_frequency[comm1].items()}
        elif idf_method == 'idf_smooth':
            inverse_document_frequency[comm1] = {k : (math.log(N/(1+v))+1) for k, v in inverse_document_frequency[comm1].items()}
    
    return inverse_document_frequency


# Lastly, the TF-IDF metric considers TF and IDF together by multiplying these two metrics in a word-wise fashion. TF shows how frequently a word occurs, while IDF could help to see whether the word is unique or not in corpus.
# 
# Let us define how to compute the TF-IDF scores for our reviews below, based on the TF and IDF scores retrieved from the earlier functions:

# In[48]:


# Function for computing TD-IDF score
def tf_idf(term_frequency, inverse_document_frequency):
    
    tf_idf = {}
    for comm in term_frequency:
        tf_idf[comm] = {k : v*term_frequency[comm][k] for k, v in inverse_document_frequency[comm].items()}
    
    return tf_idf


# Now that we have defined the necessary functions to perform the calculations of these metrics, let us run them upon our `reviews` dataset:

# In[49]:


# Convert reviews of each business into one text for analysis

business_reviews = reviews(df = business_review_df, 
                           mode = 'business')


# In[50]:


# Calculate term frequency for each business

business_term_frequency = tf(reviews = business_reviews, 
                             tf_method = 'term_frequency')


# In[51]:


# Calculate inverse document frequency for each business

business_inverse_document_frequency = idf(reviews = business_reviews, 
                                          term_frequency = business_term_frequency, 
                                          idf_method = 'idf')


# In[52]:


# Calculate TF-IDF score for each business

business_tf_idf = tf_idf(term_frequency = business_term_frequency,  
                         inverse_document_frequency = business_inverse_document_frequency)


# By sorting the word terms descendingly by their TF-IDF score, we are able to find the top $N$ keywords which best identify and describe a particular hotel, based on all the reviews from its users. Let us create this function below.

# In[53]:


# Function for extracting top keywords with highest TF-IDF score of each business
def retrieve_top_n_keywords(n, tf_idf_score = business_tf_idf):
    
    # Create a dictionary, which will contain top n keywords for each business
    top_keywords_dict = {}
    
    # For each business, we will save its business_id and its top n keywords in a dictionary
    for business_id, term_dict in tf_idf_score.items():
        
        # Sort the terms by their TF-IDF score (descendingly), and keep the top n keywords
        top_n_keywords_list = [tf_idf_tuple[0] for tf_idf_tuple in sorted(term_dict.items(), key = (lambda x : x[1]), reverse = True)][0:n]
        top_keywords_dict[business_id] = list(top_n_keywords_list)
        
    return top_keywords_dict


# We will apply the function by appropriately selecting $N$, which is the number of top keywords that we want to retrieve from the TF-IDF term ranking.
# 
# At the same time, this number is essential for our Network Analysis, since $N$ dictates how many keywords each node will have available to check for matching with keywords of other nodes. The smaller the $N$ is selected to be, the fewer keywords will be available for nodes to match on and create edges between them, therefore a smaller number of top keywords will be directly proportional to a smaller number of edges created in our network.

# In[54]:


n = 10
business_top_keywords = retrieve_top_n_keywords(n)


# For the sake of easy retrieval, let us also store these top keywords of each business in the original `business` dataframe, in a new column.

# In[55]:


# Add a column containing top keywords of each business to the original dataframe
business_df['top_keywords'] = business_df['business_id'].map(business_top_keywords)

# ## 5. Network Analysis upon the Yelp hotel dataset  

# <a id='5.1.'></a>
# ### 5.1. Creating the network graph

# After we have determined the top $N$ most relevant keywords for each business in part, it is now time to investigate graph analytics upon the business network determined by the Yelp hotels.
# 
# The purpose of creating and visualizing such a network is to be able to identify hotels which are "connected" with each other by their unique words in their reviews, thereby identifying what each hotel is "distinguishing" itself compared to the others in the hotel landscape of Las Vegas. At the same time, two hotels/nodes who are strongly connected in our network can identify a potential "competitor" relationship between two businesses, since the hotels would share in common multiple distinguishing words.
# 
# First let us create the __undirected network graph__, where the nodes are our analyzed businesses:

# In[57]:


G = nx.Graph()

# Add nodes
G.add_nodes_from(business_top_keywords.keys())
print('Initially, the total number of nodes/businesses in the network is:', G.number_of_nodes())

# Assign business name as an attribute to each node/business (for plotting it later)
for node in G.nodes:
    G.nodes[node]['business_name'] = business_df.name[business_df.business_id == node].values[0]


# We will remodel the "top keywords" dictionary into a dataframe in long-format, where each row corresponds to a (business_id, unique_keyword) combination. This specific form for the dataframe is necessary, so that we can group by keywords afterwards, and identify which businesses share a keyword in common.

# In[58]:


keyword_df = pd.DataFrame(business_top_keywords).melt(var_name = 'business_id', value_name = 'keywords').reset_index()


# In[59]:


# Group keywords by 'business_id', to find the businesses sharing top keywords

grouped_keyword_df = keyword_df.groupby(['keywords', 'business_id']).count()['index']


# Here, we will connect the nodes by their keywords, creating edges. Also, the __weight of the edges__ will be taken into account as representing the total number of top keywords that two hotel businesses share in common.

# In[60]:


# Here, we are iterating through the grouped set of keywords, 
# and if two businesses have the same keyword in common, we will create a network edge between the two busineses

for _, business_sub_df in grouped_keyword_df.groupby(level = 0):
    
    # This is a list of combinations of 2 businesses which have the same top keyword in common
    edges_list = list(itertools.combinations(business_sub_df.droplevel(0).index, 2))
    
    for node1, node2 in edges_list:
        
        if G.has_edge(node1, node2):
            # we added this connection before, just increase the weight by one
            G[node1][node2]['weight'] += 1
            
        else:
            # new edge, therefore initialize link with weight = 1
            G.add_edge(node1, node2, weight = 1)


# In[61]:


print('Using the top n = %d keywords from TF-IDF, the initialized number of edges is: %d' % (n, G.number_of_edges()))


# As we can see above, the number of edges connecting different parts of this network is quite large (> 10000 edges), especially since we have selected a more generous number ($N = 10$) of top keywords that the nodes are allowed to match on. The reason behind this choice is that if we decrease this number to 5 or 3 keywords, the degrees of the nodes in the graph will fall dramatically and there will be more isolated nodes in the graph, which is a behaviour we do not want.

# Finally here, let us remove the (few) isolated nodes in the graph, locate the main connected component of the graph (GCC) and focus our analysis on specifically these kinds of nodes:

# In[62]:


# Remove the isolated nodes from the graph
G.remove_nodes_from(list(nx.isolates(G)))

# Remove nodes outside the main connected component (i.e. outside the GCC)
for component in list(nx.connected_components(G.to_undirected())):
    if (len(component) < 5):
        for node in component:
            G.remove_node(node)

print('After removal of isolated or non-GCC nodes, the total number of nodes/businesses in the network is:', G.number_of_nodes())
print('Also, the number of edges present in the network now is:', G.number_of_edges())


# Through the code above, we have also presented preliminary descriptive statistics upon the network graph, which contains ___421 nodes___ which we are working with, as well as ___10790 edges___ connecting the various hotel busineses together.

# <a id='5.2.'></a>
# ### 5.2. Visual plotting of the network graph

# In order to visualize how the constructed graph looks like, we will use a __force-directed layout__ for our graph, based on the Force Atlas algorithm, which computes node positions spatializing our undirected weighted graph. 
# 
# The node positions will be calculated at the next step, before being fed into the plotting function.

# In[123]:


# Create instance for FA2
forceatlas2 = FA2(scalingRatio = 100, gravity = 100, outboundAttractionDistribution = True)

# Calculate positions of nodes in the visualization
positions = forceatlas2.forceatlas2_networkx_layout(G, pos = None, iterations = 1000)


# Here, we will also create a list of node sizes based on the total number of reviews that each hotel has, multiplied by a minimizing constant, so as to make the sizes reasonable to display. Therefore, very popular hotels will have higher node sizes than most others.

# In[124]:


node_sizes = []

for node in G:
    
    total_reviews = business_df[business_df.business_id == node].review_count
    
    # Append the appropriate size to a node
    node_sizes.append(total_reviews * 0.025)


# Finally, here we will plot the static graph visualization using networkx and matplotlib's underlying drawing functions. This graph helps us understand how connected the hotel business landscape in Las Vegas is, and also helps us identify what role in the network the very popular hotels are playing.

# In[125]:


plt.figure(figsize = (12, 12))
plt.tight_layout()

nx.draw(G, pos = positions, node_size = node_sizes, node_color = 'darkgreen', width = 0.01)


# The results of the graph plotting are very interesting: it seems that some hotels which are not so popular are having similar degree of connecting as the very popular nodes in the network. Therefore, it does not appear that there is a relationship between how popular a business is and how many competitors it has.
# 
# At the same time, it appears that there are many edge nodes which have fewer links to other nodes in the network than the majority. These results are just detected from eye-measuring the graph, and in order to make a responsible analysis with concrete numbers, we will have a look at the degree distribution of this network, in order to check for any network effects there. 

# However, before checking the degree distribution, we wanted to take the graph visualizations to a dynamical space, where we can actually manipulate and zoom into the graph's structure in order to understand its connections, since this is not a traditional easy-to-interpret graph. 
# 
# We will perform an interactive representation of the previous plot using the Python library ___`Plotly`___.

# In[163]:


# Extract latitude of hotel corresponding to each node
lat = list(business_df[business_df.business_id.isin(G.nodes())].latitude)

# By hovering over the interactive graph, we are able to find how many connections each hotel has with its neighbors/competitors. It can be clearly seen that the most popular nodes are also some of the ones with highest degree of connection, meaning that they share a larger number of competitors than most other businesses (___let's remember that node size is solely determined by the number of reviews a hotel received___).

# ### 5.3. Degree distribution & comparison with random network

# 
# One way to verify whether such assumptions are correct is by plotting the linear and log-log degree distribution of the network, as done below.

# As we can see above, there seems to be some form of a weak scale-free behavior in the network, since the log "degree distribution" tends to follow a power law, albeit with a rather large number of deviations from such behavior. 
# 
# Another sign which demonstrates the weak presence of a scale-free influence in the graph is the large maximum degree number present in the dataset, indicating the presence of a certain number of hubs, although the linear scale demonstrates that the distribution has many modes and a large number local minima points, thus deviating from the expected behavior of Barabasi-Albert graphs. The minimum degree number being $1$ also is a sign referring to a BA-graph behaviour, since, after all, a BA network a fully connected graph.
# 
# Let us try to compare these results with the results of a random network having the same number of starting nodes and a probability $p$ of connection to other nodes. The network that we will compare against is an __undirected ErdÅs-RÃ©nyi (random) graph__, with $p$ being computed by calculation upon the degrees of our hotel network.
# 
# Let us first compute $p$ below, knowing that $p = \frac{<k>}{N-1}$:

# In[171]:


# Calculate the average of all degrees in the Hotels graph
k = np.mean([x[1] for x in list(G.degree())])

# N is the total number of nodes
N = G.number_of_nodes()


# In[172]:


p = k / (N - 1)
print('The value of "p" is:', p)


# Now, let us generate the (undirected) random network:

# In[173]:


random_G = nx.fast_gnp_random_graph(n = N, p = p, seed = 3, directed = True)


# Finally, let us take a look at the degree distribution for the random network, and see how it compares with the previous results from our Hotels network:

# In[174]:


# Here, we have discarded the nodes with degree 0
degree_list = [x[1] for x in list(random_G.degree()) if x[1] != 0]

max_degree = max(degree_list)
min_degree = min(degree_list)

print('The maximum degree in the random network is:', max_degree)
print('The minimum degree in the random network is:', min_degree)


# In[175]:


hist, bins = np.histogram(degree_list, bins = len(set(degree_list)))

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize = (18, 5))

counts = axs[0].hist(degree_list, bins = bins, ec = "white")
axs[0].set_title('Histogram of the degree distribution for the Random Network [Isolated]')
axs[0].set_yticks(ticks = range(0, max(hist) + 1, 100));
axs[0].set_xlabel('Degree (linear)')
axs[0].set_ylabel('Frequency')

axs[1].loglog(bins[:-1], hist, 'bo', markersize = 7)
axs[1].set_title('Degree distribution (Log-Log) for the Random Network [Isolated]')
axs[1].set_xlabel('Degree (log-log)')
axs[1].set_ylabel('Frequency');


# The degree distribution for the random network can easily be approximated with a Poisson distribution centered unimodally. This is very different than the scale-free behaviour we have seen in BA graphs, as well in our graph, where the distribution resembled a power law much more than a Poisson.
# 
# In conclusion, it seems that, in our Hotel network graph, there will be some "hubs" which will represent important competitors for most other hotels, even though the large selected number of top keywords available ($N = 10$) has generally given a significant "boost" to the degree values for all nodes across the entire span of the graph.

# ### 5.4. Network community detection & analysis

# Looking at the original graph, it is good to visualize an overview of our Hotels network, however we are wondering if there are any groupings or clusters of hotels which are similar in terms of their special features or experiences (which get mentioned in users' reviews).
# 
# For this, we will try to compute and maximize the modularity score of each group of nodes through using the __Louvain__ algorithm, which looks as how much more densely connected the nodes in a community are, compared to how connected the same nodes would be in a random network. The Louvain algorithm is an unsupervised clustering method, and allows finding of the best partition of nodes into communities from a full-scale graph.
# 
# We will also set a set a seed for the algorithm, in order to achieve reproducibility of our results when re-running this project notebook:

# In[176]:


# Find the best community partition for the DC universe
partition_hotels = community.best_partition(G, random_state = 3)

print("The Louvain algorithm has found", len(set(partition_hotels.values())), "communities for hotel landscape in Las Vegas.")


# From the optimal partition, we have identified 4 communities which these hotels are grouped into. It is very important and relevant to visualize the distribution of each community's nodes across the original graph landscape, which is why we want to visualize the community graph.
# 
# The Force-Atlas positions computed previously will be kept and reused for this visualization, since then it allows for the graph layout to be preserved in its entirely, allowing us to only focus on the presence of communities.

# In[177]:


# For this visualization, let us split the nodes by their community number
dict_communities = {}

for community_nr in range(0, max(partition_hotels.values()) + 1):
    dict_communities[community_nr] = [name for name, comm in partition_hotels.items() if comm == community_nr]


# In[178]:


character_color_dict = {}
community_color_list = ['#00FA9A', '#0000FF', '#228B22', '#6495ED']

for community_nr, character_name_list in dict_communities.items():
    
    # For every node in this community, we assign them a previously-computed color
    for character_name in character_name_list:
        character_color_dict[character_name] = community_color_list[community_nr]
                
        
# The node colors in the DICT are not in the same order as the nodes in the graph, therefore we need to create a separate list to deal with that

for node in G:
    
    # Append the appropriate color to a node
    node_color_list.append(character_color_dict[node])

    # Append the appropriate size to a node
    node_size_list.append(G.degree(node) * 0.6)

plt.title("Louvain community partitioning for the Yelp-registered hotels in Las Vegas, using Force-Atlas node coordinates", fontsize = 16);


# The visual representation shows a clear separation of the network plot into the 4 communities, which is a very nice result. It seems that there are 3 large communities of approximatively similar sizes, and one smaller community whose nodes are scattered across the graph due to their interaction with a wide variety of hotels located all across the graph.
# 
# The plot shows that, for each community, there seems to interact a significant interaction with other community's nodes, although nodes from a community will always interact most with other nodes from the same community, as per the modularity maximization principle which the Louvain algorithm used for finding the best partition. This means that, although communities have been found, there are some top keywords which are shared highly by a large number of hotels across all communities.

# Of course, besides the static visualization, an interactive method of finding __exactly which Hotels (identified by name) belong to which community__ can be useful. We will again use the ___`Plotly`___ library to show which businesses belong to which communities, in an aesthetically-pleasing manner.

# The visualization helps easily see that some of the very popular hotels are residing in Community 3, and that perhaps might have an important effect as to why they have been grouped together in the same community. 
# 
# By hovering over the interactive graph, we are able to find which hotels are belonging to what community.

# ### 5.5. Community wordclouds 

# Lastly in this network analysis project part, we will take a look at what words characterize each community. It is relevant to see this, in order to understand if there is a trend for why certain hotels were grouped together, and also for understanding what kind of experiences do you normally get from hotels in that community.
# 
# Firstly, we need to aggregate all the reviews for each community independently, and calculate TF, IDF and TF-IDF scores upon their aggregated reviews.

# In[147]:

# 
# Since there are 4 communities, we decided to add a playful twist to the wordcloud figure, and represent each of them using the famous playing card suit set: _club, diamond, spade and heart_.

# ## 6. Topic detection using LDA

# __Topic modelling__ is a tool for discovering hidden abstract semantic structures of texts, where __Latent Dirichlet allocation__ (known as LDA) as an unsupervised learning method is one way of performing topic modelling. 
# 
# Normally, LDA can be applied when we are trying to understand the latent topics in a large document collection without knowing what kind of topics there will be. The main idea of it is "treat each document as a certain proportion of the topic collection, and each topic as a collection of keywords, again in a certain proportion". And the brief introduction of LDA is shown as below:
# 
# * 

# Once you provide the algorithm with the number of topics, it will rearrange the topic distribution in the document and the keyword distribution within the topic to get a good combination of topic-keyword distribution.

# However, after performing community detection using Louvain algorithm, the original dataset containing reviews has been split into 4 main parts. So it can be expected that LDA model would

# ## 7. Sentiment Analysis upon the hotel reviews

# <a id='7.1.'></a>
# ### 7.1. Finding the sentiment trends

# Finally for our project, we are interested in understanding which hotels were given the most positive reviews and which hotels were performing poorest. Since there is a large set of reviews written by independent users, we can suggest that, by performing sentiment analysis upon the aggregated reviews for each hotel in part, we will be able to find the best hotels in Las Vegas.

# Our sentiment analysis is dependent on an initial set of words which have sentiment scoring, used for comparing back to the words found in our reviews.
# 
# This happens to be one of major researches of Prof. __Finn Ãrup Nielsen__, researcher at DTU Compute, which created the __[AFINN](https://github.com/fnielsen/afinn) dataset__. AFINN is a list of words rated for sentimental valence, and scored on an integer scale between -5 (negative) and 5 (positive). Therefore, a completely neutral word or sentence would have a score of 0. This dataset has been updated several times throughout the years, with the latest update being in 2015. This is the dataset which we are using.

# 
# * Extract words from reviews
# * Remove stopwords to minimize the influence of the most common words (which often do not indicate emotional feelings on purpose)
# * Use AFINN-165 sentiment score dictionary (as reference) to obtain the sentiment score of each word
# * Sum up the sentiment scores of each word shown in the review text and compute the average sentiment by dividing the number of words

# From the histogram of sentiment-score distribution over hotels, it can be noticed that the sentiment scores are ranging between $(-1.5, 2.5)$ and follow a positively skewed distribution, which indicates that the overall distribution of all hotels is slightly emotionally positive. 
# 
# Also, we are able to observe that the sentiment-score distribution of the diagram __'without stopwords'__ seems to spread out slightly more than __'with stopwords'__, which is a consequence of the fact that the stopwords are often neutral. However, in general, these two cases are following a similar trend in terms of distribution shape, therefore __only the version with stopwords will be considered in the subsequent analysis__, so as to guarantee the accuracy of sentiment scores.

# Next, let us look at the "best and worst" hotels, meaning the hotels where the sentiment scores are most positive or most negative:

# In[56]:


# Add sentiment score to business_df
business_df['sentiment'] = business_df['business_id'].map(business_sentiment_with_stopwords)  


# In our dataset, there already is an aggregate "rating" score (from 1 to 5) corresponding to the average of the number of stars that a hotel accumulated across all its user reviews.
# 
# We would like to try and understand if there is any relationship between the sentiment scores we find and the ratings of such hotels:

# In[157]:


i = 1
# Sort the sentiment score dictionary of businesses by value from highest to lowest and pick top 10

for key, value in sorted(business_sentiment_with_stopwords.items(), key = lambda x:x[1], reverse = True)[:10]:
    print('#{} {} -  Sentiment: {}, Rating: {}'.format(i, 
                                                                 business_df[business_df.business_id == key].name.values[0], 
                                                                 value, 
                                                                 business_df[business_df.business_id == key].stars.values[0]))
    i += 1


# In[158]:

    print('#{} {}: Sentiment-{}, Rating-{}'.format(i, 
                                                                 business_df[business_df.business_id == key].name.values[0], 
                                                                 value, 
                                                                 business_df[business_df.business_id == key].stars.values[0]))

# It can be clearly seen that hotels with most positive sentiment scores are also rated relatively high, and vice versa, which shows consistency between sentiment scores and rating scores.

# When it comes to the communities, there are many possible discussions regarding sentiment score, however here, we will be interested in showing what each community's overall sentiment is. 

# In[159]:


community_sentiment_with_stopwords = sentiment_score(community_reviews, remove_stopwords = False)


# In[160]:


print(community_sentiment_with_stopwords)


# Since we already have looked at the community wordclouds in a previous section, we can see that the results fall very well in line with our findings: community nr. 1 was the community which contained most top keywords as swear words or inappropriate words such as 'strip'. 
# 
# As it can be noted, the overall community score is not very far from neutral, since the number of reviews for each community is very large, and therefore strong sentiments on either positive or negative scales 'cancel out', and the general trend becomes almost-neutral.

# ### 7.2. Temporal sentiment-score map

# Now that we have identified the general sentiment trends across our Yelp Hotels dataset, it is important to also link these sentiments to the geo-temporal dimension that our dataset comes from. In other words, we know that each hotel is located at a specific (latitude, longitude) location, and that every review has been written at a certain date and hour in time.
# 
# We will use these two dimensions to analyze an interactive geo-map, where we position the hotels according to their location on the map, and their sentiment scores in the time domain will dictate the color of their node.
# 
# The following two cases are considered:
# 
# 1. Seasonal temporal map, where we will check if sentiment scores change based on the year quarter in which they were written
# 
# 2. Time-of-day temporal map, where we will check the trend of sentiment scores across the 5 different times of day during which they were written (morning, noon, afternoon, evening, night).

# In[161]:


# Convert date object to datetime type
business_review_df.date = pd.to_datetime(business_review_df.date)


# <a id='7.2.1.'></a>
# #### 7.2.1. Seasonal temporal map

# Here, we will compute sentiment scores of businesses in each quarter of year, to see if there is any variation between seasons:

# In[162]:


# Function for split date into quarters
def quarter(df):
    # Q1
    if (df.month >= 1) & (df.month < 4):
        return 'Q1'
    # Q2
    if (df.month >= 4) & (df.month < 7):
        return 'Q2'
    # Q3
    if (df.month >= 7) & (df.month < 10):
        return 'Q3'
    # Q4
    if (df.month >= 10) & (df.month <= 12):
        return 'Q4'


# * Compute sentiment scores of businesses in each part of the day, to see if there is temporal change over different day time:

# In[163]:


# Function for split date into quarters
def hour(df):
    # Midnight
    if (df.hour >= 0) & (df.hour < 6):
        return 'Night'
    # Morning
    if (df.hour >= 6) & (df.hour < 11):

    # Afternoon
    if (df.hour >= 14) & (df.hour < 18):
        return 'Afternoon'  
    # Night
    if (df.hour >= 18) & (df.hour <= 23):
        return 'Evening'
